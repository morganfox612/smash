# Explaining my code

## Creating my grid
I used 9 divs to create my grid. I then gave each div its on id so that I was able to individually edit them in css. After that I found pictures to insert into my grid.

## Making my grid look nice
After I got all of my images into my grid, I modified their sizes to fit and gave each picture a border with a color that matches them.

## Creating my overlay effect
I created another div within each of my divs and gave them the class of container. Once I did that I modified the container to how I wanted my overlay to appear. After that, I added a hover in order for me to use my overlay.
